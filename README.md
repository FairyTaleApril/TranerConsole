# TranerConsole
My ROV, Traner's console web.

Under the flasktranser folder is the code of console web, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and website logo. In addition, there are communication programs based on mqtt. Since the control website is deployed offline in the robot master (raspberry pie), EMQX Broker needs to be installed in advance.

Another folder is the MCU program, you can refer to it.
